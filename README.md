# Literature Data Analysis

In this project I use cuantitative methods to explore books written by some of my favorite authors. This gives me the chance to put in practice some NLP and data visualisation techniques. Some of the questions I'de like to answer: which words appear more ofter in a certain book? How wide is an author's vocabulary? How are characters distributed throughtout a novel? 

## Books analysed

- Cien años de soledad (1967). Gabriel García Márquez.
- Rayuela (1963). Julio Cortázar.
